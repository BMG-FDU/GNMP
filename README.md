Physics-informed graph neural networks for predicting deformation in disordered fibrous materials

Disordered fibrous networks underpin essential mechanical functionalities in biological tissues and engineered materials. Predicting their nonlinear deformation behavior remains challenging due to complex, non-affine mechanisms governed by sparse connectivity. We introduce a physics-informed, graph-learning-based Network Mechanics Prediction (GNMP) approach that precisely predicts mechanical deformation in two-dimensional semi-flexible fibrous networks. Leveraging graph attention mechanisms and dynamic physical constraints from molecular dynamics simulations, GNMP accurately captures non-affine deformation behaviors. Our method significantly surpasses conventional neural network approaches in accuracy and increases computational efficiency more than tenfold compared to molecular dynamics simulations. Experimental validations using three-dimensionally printed specimens show congruent spatial overlays and consistent descriptor trends with GNMP predictions. This study establishes a computational methodology for modeling sparse fibrous networks, enabling accelerated design of biomimetic soft tissues, flexible electronics, and advanced functional materials.
